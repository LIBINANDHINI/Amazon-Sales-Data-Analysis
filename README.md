Data Cleaning : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights. 
Data Preprocessing : Modified the structure of data in order to make it more understandable and suitable and convenient for statistical analysis. 
Data Analysis : I started analyzing dataset using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Data Visualization : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables. Also used Power BI for data visualization.
